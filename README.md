This outlines the software installations to prepare a new MacBook for development. The commands have been outlined below to allow you to walk through the checklist yourself, but I've also included a shell script to automate the process, should you prefer that approach.

## The Checklist
There are a number of installation approaches that will be used during this process, each following the proscribed best practice for each software installation. Here's a birds-eye view of that checklist:

* Scripts
  * Homebrew
  * `nvm` (`npm`, `node`)

* Homebrew (`brew`)
  * `git`
  * AWS CLI (`aws`)
  * AWS SAM CLI (`sam`)
  * Docker Toolbox (if desired)

* Installers
  * Docker Desktop
  * AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

* `npm` (global)
  * `npx`
  * `yarn`

* `npm` (project)
  * `typescript`
  * `@types/typescript`
  * `ts-node`
  * `jest`
  * `ts-jest`
  * `@types/jest`
  *  AWS CDK (`cdk`)

### Scripts
This section will walk you through the scripts available online for the software installations that call that out as the proscribed means to install that product.

#### Homebrew (brew)

#### nvm (node,npm)

### Homebrew
This section will walk you through the details for each software installation available through a Homebrew formula. But, as a shortcut, you're welcome to use the Brewfile that's part of this repo.

#### git
#### AWS CLI
#### AWS SAM CLI
#### Docker Toolbox (if desired)

### Installers
This section will walk you through the details for each software installation that requires a custom installer.

#### Docker Desktop
#### AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

### npm (global)
There are several tools for use with `npm`, so I've included the details to walk you through the most frequently used ones.

#### npx
#### yarn

### npm (project)
This last section is optional, but it lists the tools I most commonly use across most projects.

#### typescript
#### @types/typescript
#### ts-node
#### jest
#### ts-jest
#### @types/jest
#### AWS CDK
